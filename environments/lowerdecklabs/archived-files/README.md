# Archived Configuration Files

This directory contains legacy configuration files that are no longer actively used but are preserved for reference.

## Files

### `oig-config/resource-owners.yml`
**Status:** Superseded
**Replaced by:** `../config/owner_mappings.json`

This was the original YAML-based format for managing resource owners. The project has migrated to JSON format for better tooling support and consistency with other configuration files.

### `api_config.json`
**Status:** Superseded
**Replaced by:** `../config/label_mappings.json`

Legacy configuration format used by an older label management approach. The current implementation uses `label_mappings.json` which provides a cleaner structure and better integration with the GitOps workflows.

**Historical context:** This file was used with the original `apply-labels.yml` workflow before the more comprehensive `apply-labels-from-config.yml` workflow was introduced.

### `label_mappings_synced.json`
**Status:** Temporary output file
**Replaced by:** Should not be committed

This is a temporary output file generated by the `sync-labels` workflow. It should not be committed to the repository and has been added to `.gitignore`.

## Why Keep These Files?

These files are archived rather than deleted to:
- Provide reference for the evolution of the configuration format
- Allow comparison if migrating data back or troubleshooting
- Document historical approaches to resource management

## Restoring Files

If you need to reference or restore any of these files:

1. **Review the file** to understand its format and purpose
2. **Check current documentation** to see the modern equivalent
3. **Migrate content** if needed using the current format

**Do not simply restore these files** as they may conflict with current workflows and configurations.
